## Central service

The central service is available at [lambda.grnet.gr](https://lambda.grnet.gr/). It collects usage metrics from user owned λ services (i.e. number of deployed λ instances/applications) and contains documentation on deploying and using a λ service. 

## Central λ API

The API listening of the central instance is responsible for collecting the usage metrics. This is not a user facing service. The central λ API UML Class diagram is shown in the following picture.
