# API - application start - Description

Application start call, given an authentication token through the header Authorization,
will firstly check the validity of the token. If the token is invalid, the API will reply
with a "401 Unauthorized" code. If the token is valid, the API will check if the lambda instance and the application exist, and if the application is deployed on the instance. If any of these conditions is not met, the API will reply with a "404 Not Found" code. If the application has already been started on the specified lambda instance, or the respective job type slot on the lambda instance is occupied, the API will reply with a "409 Conflict" code. If the application is deployed on the lambda instance, has not been started, and its job slot is free, the API
will reply with a "202 Accepted" code and will start the application on the lambda instance.
